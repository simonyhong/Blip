## In brief:<br>
This software suite uses your Windows PC and a "NI-PCIe 6353" or similar board to:<br> 
>(1) collect realtime data from analog/digital signal sources<br> 
>(2) interact with the experiment instrument and subjects<br>
>(3) online analyze signals and plot them<br>
>(4) guide the 3D position of the probe in 3D MRI (in case you use MRI)</p>

Also it has an open code format with which you can write your own experiment process.<p><p>
 

## Changes:<br>
>(1) Bug fix in RAS<br>
>(2) VIS can display disks
